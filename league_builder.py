# 4. Create a text file named teams.txt that includes the name of a team, followed
# by the players on that team. List all three teams and their players.

# 5. In the list of teams, include the team name on one line, followed by a
# separate line for each player. Include the player's name, whether the player has
# experience playing soccer, and the player's guardian names. Separate each bit of
# player information by a comma. For example, the text file might start something
# like this:
# Sharks
# Frank Jones, YES, Jim and Jan Jones
# Sarah Palmer, YES, Robin and Sari Washington
# Joe Smith, NO, Bob and Jamie Smith

# kenneth_love.txt. Make sure that each file begins with the text "Dear"
# followed by the guardian(s) name(s). Also include the additional required
# information: player's name, team name, and date & time of first practice.
